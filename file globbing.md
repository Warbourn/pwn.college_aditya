# File Globbing

## 1. Matching with *
Now, practice this yourself! Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, but use globbing to keep the argument you pass to cd to at most four characters! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag!

hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:

```

## 2. Matching with ?
Now, practice this yourself! Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, but use the ? character instead of c and l in the argument to cd! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag!

## 3. Matching with []
We've placed a bunch of files in /challenge/files. Change your working directory to /challenge/files and run /challenge/run with a single argument that bracket-globs into file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h!

Error: you called this command with more than 1 argument (pre-globbing)! Please 
call me with one argument.

## 4. Matching paths with []
Now it's your turn. Once more, we've placed a bunch of files in /challenge/files. Starting from your home directory, run /challenge/run with a single argument that bracket-globs into the absolute paths to the file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h files!

## 5. Multiple globs
Now you try it. We put a few happy, but diversely-named files in /challenge/files. Go cd there and run /challenge/run, providing a single argument: a short (3 characters or less) globbed word with two * globs in it that covers every word that contains the letter p.

hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ challenge/run p**
bash: challenge/run: No such file or directory
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run p**
Your expansion did not expand to the requested files (happy optimistic pwning 
splendid uplifting).
Instead, it expanded to:
pwning
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *p*
You got it! Here is your flag!

## 6. Mixing globs
Now, let's put the previous levels together! We put a few happy, but diversely-named files in /challenge/files. Go cd there and, using the globbing you've learned, write a single, short (6 characters or less) glob that (when passed as an argument to /challenge/run) will match the files "challenging", "educational", and "pwning"!

## 8. Tab completion
This challenge has copied the flag into /challenge/pwncollege, and you can freely cat that file. But you can't type the filename: we used some serious trickery to make sure that you must tab-complete it. Try it out!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wAcaYXdSVqMxmD42aANgSJ0RYad.0FN0EzNxwiMxITNxEzW}`

As the description had already said, all you needed to do is press tab. Untill /challenge/pwn I typed then i  pressed <tab> and hence it got tabbed and gave the flag.

```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwnncollegeâ€‹ 
pwn.college{wAcaYXdSVqMxmD42aANgSJ0RYad.0FN0EzNxwiMxITNxEzW}

## 10. Tab completion on commands
Tab completion is for more than files! You can also tab-complete commands. This level has a command that starts with pwncollege, and it'll give you the flag. Type pwncollege and hit the tab key to auto-complete it!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{w0U6pkLpAvV9JOP_cRt2fYFgTQA.0VN0EzNxwiMxITNxEzW}`

As the description had already said, all you needed to do is press tab. Untill /challenge/pwn I typed then i  pressed <tab> and hence it got tabbed and gave the flag.

```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-9432 
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{w0U6pkLpAvV9JOP_cRt2fYFgTQA.0VN0EzNxwiMxITNxEzW}
